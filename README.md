# Create PeopleSoft App repository

This project creates PeopleSoft boilerplate apps.

Running the npx script `npx create-peoplesoft-app` will prompt you for some basic information regarding your app and PeopleSoft environment. The script will generate all of the necessary PeopleCode and PeopleSoft objects to serve your app from an IScript endpoint.

The script will also generate a basic frontend React app with a build configuration that generates the required .js files to be deployed to Peoplesoft.
